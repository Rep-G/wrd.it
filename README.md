# wrd.it
## What is it?
wrd.it is what I think the worlds hardest word guessing game.
## Can you give me an example word?
For sure! The hint ```(of animals) Not purebred; of an inferior strain```, relates to the word underbred, trust me that's one of the easiest.
## How does it work?
The project calls a random word API, the returned word is then put into a dictionary API. The definition of the word is used for the hint, and then you have to guess the word.
## Can I use this work?
Of course, feel free to change, analyze, improve, and whatever else you might want to do!
